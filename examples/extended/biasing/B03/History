                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

Nov 24th, 2013 A. Howard - B03-V09-06-04
- Set default number of MT cores back to two

Nov 24th, 2013 A. Howard - B03-V09-06-03
- Synchronised geometry with B01 and B02
- Corrected english mistakes in variable names

Nov 23rd, 2013 A. Howard - B03-V09-06-02
- Prevented case of double biasing process in single threaded mode
- Removed unsused scoring classes B03ScoringDetectorConstruction,
  B03PSScoringDetectorConstruction

Nov 22nd, 2013 A. Howard - B03-V09-06-01
- Fixed typos and removed unused variables

Nov 22nd, 2013 A. Howard - B03-V09-06-00
