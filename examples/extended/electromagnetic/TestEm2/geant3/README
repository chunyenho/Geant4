 testem2.cra is the geant3 equivalent of TestEm2
 
 % cd geant3
 % gmakeB           to make an executable  (Batch version) 
 % gmakeT           to make an executable  (inTeractive version)
 
 To execute:
  
 % cd geant3
 % $G4SYSTEM/testem2.xb (for batch) or testem2.xt (for interactive)
 
 The program will ask:
 G3 > gives the filename of the data cards to be read:
 
 run01.dat      (runNN.dat is the equivalent of the G4 runNN.mac)
 
 
 testem2 produces several histo saved as testem2.paw if ISWIT(2)=1
 
 Content of these histo:
  
      1 : energy deposit       per event
      2 : charged track length per event
      3 : neutral track length per event
            
      4 : longitudinal energy profile
      5 : rms of longitudinal energy profile      
      6 : cumulated longitudinal energy profile
      7 : rms of cumulated longitudinal energy profile
                      
      8 : radial energy profile
      9 : rms of radial energy profile           
     10 : cumulated radial energy profile
     11 : rms of cumulated radial energy profile  

     21 : edep distrib as function of kine energy of contributing particle
     22 : cumulative distrib of 21 

 It is possible to set the max allowed step size STEMAX,
 via the data card:
 STEPMX  stepmax (in cm)
 (However this value will be taken into account only if auto=0)
