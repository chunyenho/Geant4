 testem13 is the geant3 equivalent of TestEm13

 % cd geant3
 % gmakeB           to make an executable  (Batch version)
 % gmakeT           to make an executable  (inTeractive version) 

 To execute:

 % cd geant3
 % $G4SYSTEM/testem13.xb (for batch) or  testem13.xt (for interactive)

 The program will ask:
 G3 > gives the filename of the data cards to be read:

 myMacro.dat      (myMacro.dat is the equivalent of the G4 myMacro.mac)

 data cards
 ----------  
 Most of the data cards used in xxxx.dat are standard data cards of GEANT3,
 but some of them are defined in testem13:

      KEY      VARIABLE/type           Short description

      FILE    fileName (character)     fileName of the histos
                                       (the FILE data card should be the
				        first, with the format A4,A2,A25)
					
      DETECTOR  MAT (integer)         mat.number  of the absorber
	        THICK (real)          X thickness of the absorber

      
 histograms
 ----------
 The list of built-in histograms is identical to TestEm13.cc 
 (see G4 README or histo.F)
 
 One can control the binning of the histograms with the data card:
  *HISTO  id1  nbBins  valMin  valMax  valUnit 
  *HISTO  id2  nbBins  valMin  valMax  valUnit
  ... etc ...........
  
  valMin and ValMax are given in the desired unit, whose numerical value must
  be specified in valUnit. Remember that Geant3 defaults are: GeV, cm, rad.
