 testem11/src is the geant3 equivalent of TestEm11
 
 % cd geant3
 % gmakeB           to make an executable  (Batch version) 
 % gmakeT           to make an executable  (inTeractive version)
 
 To execute:
  
 % cd geant3
 % $G4SYSTEM/testem1.xb (for batch) or testem1.xt (for interactive)
 
 The program will ask:
 G3 > gives the filename of the data cards to be read:
 
 run01.dat      (runNN.dat is the equivalent of the G4 runNN.mac)
 
 
 testem11 can produce several histo saved if ISWIT(2)=1
     
     Content of these histo:

     1    'Edep (MeV/mm) along absorber',	      
     2    'total energy deposit in absorber',					 
     3    'true track length of the primary particle',
     4    'true step size of the primary particle',
     5    'projected range of the primary particle',
     6    'true track length of charged secondaries',
     7    'true step size of charged secondaries' 
     
          
 One can control the binning of the histograms with the data card:
  *HISTO  id1  nbBins  valMin  valMax  valUnit 
  *HISTO  id2  nbBins  valMin  valMax  valUnit
  ... etc ...........
  
  valMin and ValMax are given in the desired unit, whose numerical value must
  be specified in valUnit. Remember that Geant3 defaults are: GeV, cm, rad.
  
 The name of de histograms file must be defined with the data card:
 FILE  fileName (character)   This data card is mandatory; it must be the first,
			      with the format A4,A2,A25

 It is possible to set the max allowed step size STEMAX,
 via the data card:
 STEPMX  stepmax (in cm)
 (However this value will be taken into account only if auto=0)
