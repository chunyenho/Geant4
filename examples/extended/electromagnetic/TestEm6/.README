/*! \page ExampleTestEm6 Example TestEm6 

  This example is intended to test the processes of gamma conversion
  to a pair of muons and annihilation of positrons with atomic
  electrons to a pair of muons.
  To make these process more visible, the usually much more frequent
  gamma conversion to a pair of electrons and the standard positron
  processes are not selected in the physics list.
	
\section TestEm6_s1 GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
  The geometry consists of a single block of a homogenous material.
     
  Two parameters define the geometry :
     - the material of the box,
     - the (full) size of the box.
  The default is 500 m of iron.
             
  In addition a transverse uniform magnetic field can be applied.
 
  The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
  but all of the above parameters can be changed interactively via
  the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class.
 	
\section TestEm6_s2 PHYSICS LIST
 
  The particle list is the one of novice/exampleN03.
  The physics list contains the 'standard' electromagnetic processes,
  and decay.
  
  For Gamma, only the GammaConversionToMuons has been registered.
  Futhermore, a high production cut (1 km, which gives infinity in energy)
  prevent any production of delta-electrons from ionization or gamma
  from bremsstrahlung.
  For Positrons, only the annihilation process is selected.
 	 
\section TestEm6_s3 AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
  The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
  block perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
  and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
  changed via the G4 build-in commands of G4ParticleGun class (see
  the macros provided with this example).
  The default is a Gamma of 100 TeV.
     
  In addition one can choose randomly the impact point of the incident
  particle. The corresponding interactive command is built in
  PrimaryGeneratorMessenger class.
             
  A RUN is a set of events.
 				
\section TestEm6_s4 VISUALIZATION
 
  The Visualization Manager is set in the main () (see TestEm6.cc).
  The initialisation of the drawing is done via the command
\verbatim
> /control/execute vis.mac
\endverbatim
 	
  The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the box.
 
  The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
  Optionaly one can choose to draw all particles, only the charged one,
  or none. This command is defined in EventActionMessenger class.

\section TestEm6_s5 PHYSICS DEMO

  The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
  in this example are set in PhysicsList class.

  In addition a build-in interactive command (/process/inactivate proname)
  allows to activate/inactivate the processes one by one.

  The threshold for producing secondaries can be changed.
  eg: 
\verbatim
/run/particle/setCut 100 micrometer
/run/initialize
\endverbatim
	 
  To visualize the GammaConversionToMuons :
\verbatim
/control/execute run01.mac
/control/execute vis.mac
/run/beamOn
\endverbatim
		 
  To visualize the AnnihiToMuPair :
\verbatim
/control/execute run11.mac
/control/execute vis.mac
/run/beamOn
\endverbatim
		  	
\section TestEm6_s6 HOW TO START ?
 
  - Execute Test  in 'batch' mode from macro files
\verbatim
% TestEm6    run01.mac
\endverbatim
 		
  - Execute Test  in 'interactive mode' with visualization
\verbatim
% TestEm6 
	....
Idle> type your commands
	....
Idle> exit
\endverbatim
 
\section TestEm6_s7 HOW TO INCREASE STATISTICS ON gamma -> mu+mu- ?
 
  The processes of gamma -> mu+mu-  and e+e- -> mu+mu-
  have a low cross section but can be important
  for leakage through thick absorbers and calorimeters.
  Straight forward simulation will be quite time consuming.
  To make the processes more visible, the cross section can be
  artificially increased by some factor (here 1000)
  using the commands  (only effective after  /run/initialize)

\verbatim
/testem/phys/SetGammaToMuPairFac  1000
/testem/phys/SetAnnihiToMuPairFac 1000
\endverbatim
 
	
\section TestEm6_s8 HISTOGRAMS
 
  Testem6 produces 6 histograms which illustrate the final state of 
  the GammaConversionToMuons process. See their definitions in RunAction.cc   
	
  By default the histograms are saved as testem6.root

  The format of the histogram file can be : root (default), xml, csv,
  by selecting g4nnn.hh in RunAction.hh
