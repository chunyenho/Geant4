21 July 2014 A. Dotti (MPI-V10-00-02)
- Fixing bug for RNG seed distribution in MT compilations
  (Bug #1653)

13 June 2014 A. Dotti (MPI-V10-00-01)
- Adding first version of G4RunMerger and 
  G4ScorerMerger

10 June 2014 A. Dotti (MPI-V10-00-00)
- New CMake receipe: increase portability of the code
 
10 Novembeer 2013 K. Murakami (MPI-V09-06-00)
[source]
- new coding guide line
- CMakeLists.txt, add BUILD_SHARED_LIBS flag for creating static lib
                  add check IntelMPI, mpiicpc
- MT migration : beamOn thread stacked to main for MT
                 use /run/beamOn command, instead of direct call of RM.BeamOn()
[examples]
- change coding guideling to the example guide 
- MT migration
- PhysicsList is changed to FTFP_BERT
- add run.mac

20 November 2012, I. Hrivnacova (MPI-V09-05-06)
- Fixed .README files

20 November 2012, I. Hrivnacova (MPI-V09-05-05)
- Fixed CmakeLists.txt in the top directory

16 November 2012, K. Murakami (MPI-V09-05-04)
- Updated CmakeLists.txt for examples. Fixed link errors.
- Updated README document.

16 November 2012, I. Hrivnacova (MPI-V09-05-03)
- Update of CMake files:
  - Added CMakeLists.txt in for processing MPI from upper directories
  - Removed exMPI02/FindROOT.cmake (available with Geant4 distribution)
  - Minor changes in exMPI01, exMPI02 CMake build in order to be able
    to build examples from the upper directories
  - Added comment lines 
  - Added copying macros in the build area
  - Install targets under CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin and not in source

15 November 2012, K. Murakami (MPI-V09-05-02)
 - typos in documents are fixed.

8 November 2012, K. Murakami (MPI-V09-05-01)
 - explicit inclusion of G4SystemOfUnits.hh and G4PhysicalConstants.hh
 - updated documentations

1 November 2012, K. Murakami (MPI-V09-05-00)
 - Migrated to CMake build with change of directory structure.
 - G4Exception is replaced with new one.
 - Fixed infinite-loop of slaves when a macro does not exists.
 - Added support for execution of maro with /control/macroPath.
 - Added best guess of selection of a UI shell.
 - Added Doxygen-style docs.

3 December 2010 K. Murakami (MPI-V09-03-02)
 - /mpi/wait command is removed. It is automatically called
   at the end of macro(batch) execution.

4 June 2010 J.Perl (MPI-V09-03-01)
 - Updated vis usage.

18 May 2010 K.Murakami (MPI-V09-03-00)
 == code review was performed. ==
 << mpi_ineterface >>
 - OpenMPI as default MPI library instead of LAM/MPI
 - improve /mpi/status command. (waste of CPU, time measurement)
 - /mpi/wait command is introduced for waiting until beamOn ends.
 - improve macro file parser
    * same parser as G4UIbatch
    * fixed unexpected behavior at the end of batch mode
 - changed "beamOn" behavior for better performance
    * thread-out for interactive, on-thread for batch
 << exMPI01 >>
 - use G4UIcsh instead of G4UItcsh because OpenMPI is now default. 
 - use G4eMultipleScattering instead of obsolete G4MultipleScattering.
 << exMPI02 >>
 - use G4UIcsh instead of G4UItcsh because OpenMPI is now default.

16 Nov. 2007 K.Murakami
 - commited to G4 CVS.
