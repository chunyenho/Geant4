This directory contains a set of dna examples.

   - dnaphysics 
       The dnaphysics example shows how to simulate track structures in liquid 
       water using the Geant4-DNA physics processes and models.

   - microdosimetry 
       The microdosimetry example simulates the track of a 5 MeV proton in 
       liquid water. 
       Geant4 standard EM models are used in the World volume while Geant4-DNA 
       models are used in a Target volume, declared as a Region.

   - chem1   Simple activation of the chemistry module.
   - chem2   Usage of TimeStepAction in the chemistry module.
   - chem3   Activate the full interactivity with the chemistry module.

   - wholenucleardna 
       Description of the full nucleus
   - pdb4dna         
       Usage of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) file format to build geometries

See the README page inside each example for more detail.
