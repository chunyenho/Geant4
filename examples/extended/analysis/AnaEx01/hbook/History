This file should be used by the G4 example coordinator to briefly
summarize all major modifications introduced in the code and keep
track of all tags.

03/11/2014 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V10-00-03)
- Updated for changes in analysis category
- Implemented P1 manager
- Added H3 and P2 dummy managers (now removed from Geant4 kernel)
- Fixed applying units
- Applied new exception classification

17/06/2014 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V10-00-02)
- Fixed problems reported by Davide Mancusi:
  - Moving tools/hbook/*.f files in examples/extended/common/analysis/src 
    to avoid their retrieval from Geant4 source/includes which causes problem 
    when building examples against Geant4 build directory. 
  - Added -lkernlib in list of libraries (required with Debian cernlib 
    distribution 20061220)
- In CMake build: replaced explicit use of gfortran with 
  enable_language(Fortran) and using fortran_sources variable in analogous 
  way as sources

12/06/2014 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V10-00-01)
- Added typedefs and functions for accessing iterators 
  over H1, H2, Ntuples;
  Usage:
   G4AnalysisManager* analysisManager = G4AnalysisManager::Instance();    
   for (G4H1Iterator it = analysisManager->BeginH1(); 
                     it != analysisManager->EndH1(); it++ ) {
      G4H1* h1 = *it;
      // call any h1 function define in tools
    }  

11/06/2014 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V10-00-00)
- Updated for changes in analysis category:
  ntuple columns of vectors (disabled), changes in ntuple_booking
- Updated to g4tools 1.10.0 (by G. Barrand):
  See History_tools for complete list of modifications.

07/11/2013 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V09-06-04)
- Implemented functions for user defined/logarithmic binning for H1 
  and H2; in case of H2 an exception is (not available in HBOOK) 

11/07/2013 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V09-06-03)
- Refactoring ExG4Hnook manager class following changes
  in analysis (analysis-V09-06-11)

20/06/2013 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V09-06-02)
- Fixed a typo in ExG4HbookAnalysisManager.hh which caused compilation
  error

03/06/2013 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V09-06-01)
- Implemented ExG4HbookAnalysisManager::Create() required with
  update for MT migration; returns an exception in case of MT mode
  (as Hbook is not supported with MT)    
  
29/03/2013 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V09-06-00)
- Updated to analysis-V09-06-05
- Extended the manager class for handling more than one ntuple  

19/11/2012 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V09-05-04)
- Updated to analysis-V09-05-15
- Adding functions for accessing h1, h2 by name
- Splitting verbose level 1 in 2 levels and shifting the upper levels
- Fixed GetH1[2]Width: return the correct value also when histogram is
  inactive.

28/08/2012 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V09-05-03)
- Updated to analysis-V09-05-10
- Adding a possibility to fill h1, h2 with values with automatically 
  applied function (eg. log10, exp)
- Pass units via a name instead of value
- Adding getters for many h1, h2 attributes 
- Adding ScaleH1(), ScaleH2()
- Adding setters/getters for histogram axis titles 
  (though they are not propagated to paw)

27/07/2012 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V09-05-02)
- Adding an additional information to analysis objects:
  units, activation option (defined in G4HnInformation.hh)
- Make possible to book histograms/ntuple before openning a file
  (using new h1_booking, h2_booking and tools::ntuple_booking classes)
- Using new bN::configure functions in SetHN(..)  
- Messages from Fill functions only in verbose level 3
- Fixes in memory management 
  delete file before opening a new one (all)
  delete ntuple before closing a file 
- Based on g4tools 1.3.1 (by G. Barrand) - see History_tools  

23/02/2012 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V09-05-01)
- Added functions to customize the HBOOK IDs by user:
     G4bool SetH1HbookIdOffset(G4int offset);
     G4bool SetH2HbookIdOffset(G4int offset);
     G4bool SetNtupleHbookId(G4int ntupleId);
  and appropriate data members and their getters
- Added setting locks introduced in the base class
- Fixed handling of directories for both histograms and ntuple

14/02/2012 I. Hrivnacova (excommon-analysis-V09-05-00)
- Adding defs include files for Hbook manager
- Adding GetNtuple() function to specific managers
- Increased granularity of verbose levels (now 3 levels are available)
- Making creating directories optional
