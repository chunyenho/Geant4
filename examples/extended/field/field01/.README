/*! \page Examplefield01 Example field01

 Example enabling investigation of tracking in a magnetic field.
 Electromagnetic processes also included.

	
\section field01_s1 GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 The "absorber" is a solid made of a given material.                

 Three parameters define the absorber :
 - the material of the absorber,
 - the thickness of an absorber,
 - the transverse size of the absorber (the input face is a square). 

 The volume "World" contains the "absorber". 
 In this test the parameters of the "World" can be changed , too.

 In addition a transverse uniform magnetic field can be applied.

 The default geometry is constructed in F01DetectorConstruction class,
 but all the parameters can be changed via
 the commands defined in the F01DetectorMessenger class.
 	
\section field01_s2 AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 The primary kinematic consists of a single particle (proton, Ekin = 1 GeV)
 which hits the
 absorber perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
 and its energy are set in the F01PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
 be changed via the G4 build-in commands of G4ParticleGun class (see
 the macros provided with this example).

 A RUN is a set of events.
 	
\section field01_s3 DETECTOR RESPONSE

  The spatial distribution of charged particles transported in magnetic
  field is envistigated.
  A HIT is a record, event per event , of all the 
  informations needed to simulate and analyse the detector response.

  In this example a F01CalorHit is defined as a set of 2 informations:
  - the total energy deposit in the absorber,
  - the total tracklength of all charged particles in the absorber,  

  Therefore  the absorber is declared
  'sensitive detector' (SD), see F01CalorimeterSD, which means they can contribute to the hit.
 				
\section field01_s4 PHYSICS DEMO
 
 The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
 in this example are set in F01PhysicsList class.

 The  messenger classes, F01PhysicsListMessenger, introduce interactive commands . Using these
 commands the geometry of the detector, the data of the primary
 particle, etc. can be changed.

\section field01_s5 HOW TO START ?
 
  - Execute field01 in 'batch' mode from macro file e.g.
\verbatim
% field01 field01.in
\endverbatim
		
  - Execute field01 in 'interactive' mode with visualization e.g.
\verbatim
% field01
....
