                      Category History file
                      ---------------------
This file should be used by G4 developers and category coordinators
to briefly summarize all major modifications introduced in the code
and keep track of all category-tags.
It DOES NOT substitute the  CVS log-message one should put at every
committal in the CVS repository !

07-November-2011: Gabriele Cosmo
- Fixed trivial compilation warning on Mac in xmlparse.cc.

02-June-2011: Ben Morgan

12-May-2011: Gunter Folger			expat-V09-04-00

  GNUmakefile, and src & include

- Files of orginal expat 2.0.1 release, no G4 mods.
