- CMakeLists.txt : Updated to build G4analysis in granular as well as global
  mode.

November 24 2001 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-14)
- Updated to g4tools-1.0.5 (G. Barrand): 
  - wroot : streamers, buffer, wbuf, named :
            arrange to avoid the usage of the std::vector<>::data() method 
            which is quite not portable for the moment.
 - remove the no more needed (and problematic) tools/vdata file. 

November 24 2001 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-13)
- tools/vdata: restored protection __GXX_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX0X__
  which got lost with update to  g4tools-1.0.4
 
November 24 2001 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-12)
- Updated to g4tools-1.0.4 (G. Barrand): 
  - Fix in tools/vdata:
    Adding a protection against an empty vector 
 
November 19 2001 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-11)
- Updated to g4tools-1.0.3 (G. Barrand): 
  - Removed warning in CHBOOK/CHPWDF
  - Remove #ifdef WIN32 in wroot/date.

November 8 2011 G.Cosmo (analysis-V09-04-10)
- tools/vdata: restored protection __GXX_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX0X__ to use of
  std::vector<>::data() feature, to allow compilation on Leopard systems.

October 27 2011 G.Cosmo (analysis-V09-04-09)
- Added workaround to use 'this' pointer for internal calls in histo/b1,
  to allow for compilation on Xcode on MacOX Lion.

October 18 2011 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-08)
- Fix in CMakeLists.txt - adding new G4AnalysisVerbose.* files

October 17 2011 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-07)
- Added support for H2 histograms
- Added verbose printing (for levels: 0,1,2)
- Updated to g4tools-1.0.2 (G. Barrand): 
  - Removed "inline" keyword for the methods having code implementation
    within classes. Dixit C++ docs, this kind of method is treated defacto 
    as "inline". The keyword "inline" remains or for functions or for the 
    few methods having their implementation outside the class.
  - Fixed some warnings (coming from Coverity or some specific version of g++) 
    about the lacking of calling the copy constructor of an inherited interface 
    in some copy constructors.
  - wroot/tree : have the streaming of the list of leaves. This permits to have
    the ROOT/TTree::Scan() method working when looking for a ntuple
    stored in a .root file as a TTree.

September 15 2011 I.Hrivnacova (analysis-V09-04-06)
- Added static access to specific manager classes.
- Migration to G4Exception for all warning/error messages.

August 4 2011 G.Cosmo (analysis-V09-04-05)
- Extended fix in tools/vdata for compilation error on olders GCC compiler
  versions (MacOSX 10.5, SLC4, ...). Addressing problem report #1238.

July 29 2011 G.Cosmo (analysis-V09-04-04)
- Fix in tools/vdata for compilation error in Intel ICC compiler.

July 28 2011 B.Morgan (analysis-V09-04-02)
- Creating new tag because previous ones were not documented here!!

July 28 2011 B.Morgan (analysis-V09-04-01.5)
- CMakeLists.txt : Added to provide CMake build for G4Analysis. Implemented
  without using a sources.cmake because we only have one library, and tools
  headers need a specialized install to retain their nested structure.

July 28 2011 G. Cosmo
- Fix in tools/wroot/file to avoid gcc dependency error on WIN32 with CygWin.


July 28, 2011 B.Morgan
- Created History file for analysis module.
