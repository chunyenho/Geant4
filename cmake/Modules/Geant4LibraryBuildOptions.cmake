# - Setup of general build options for Geant4 Libraries
#
# In addition to the core compiler/linker flags (configured in the
# Geant4MakeRules_<LANG>.cmake files) for Geant4, the build may require
# further configuration. This module performs this task whicj includes:
#
#  1) Extra build modes for developers
#  2) Additional compiler definitions to assist visualization or optimize
#     performance.
#  3) Additional compiler flags which may be added optionally.
#  4) Whether to build shared and/or static libraries.
#  5) Whether to build libraries in global or granular format.
